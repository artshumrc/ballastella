<!--
	MapLibre gives the canvas `tabindex="0"`, a `role`, and an accessible name, and handles arrow-key
	panning and +/- zooming itself, so the pane is keyboard operable without anything added here.

	The testid names this container specifically because MapLibre appends overlay points *into* it,
	and both panes' points use identical markup — so telling one pane's Control Points from the
	other's is a question about which container they are in. Distinguishing them by anything else
	(canvas order, negation against the image pane's testid) is the kind of selector that passes until
	the layout moves.
