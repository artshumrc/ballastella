// `EditorSession` against an in-memory store (ticket 06).
//
// The session takes a `ProjectStore`, so an in-memory one is the whole of what a test needs — which
// is what makes this the second thing worth having a Node seam for. What is asserted here is the
// pair of failure paths behind the "Add a Historical Map" dialog: a Workspace whose `images/`
// cannot be walked, and a map whose record does not say how big it is. Both are refusals, both are
// a sentence a user reads, and neither has a gesture in the interface that produces it on demand.
